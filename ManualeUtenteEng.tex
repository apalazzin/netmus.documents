\emph{** If you wanna use NetMus with Microsoft Internet Explorer, you have to
download the Google Chrome Frame plugin for IE, because this web browser doesn't

\newpage
\section{Utilizzare NetMus}
Let's look at how to use \co{NetMus}

\subsection{Registering to NetMus}

Go at the link \url{http://netmusbeta.appspot.com} to start using \co{NetMus}.\\
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=14cm]{img/MU/login.png}
\caption{Interface of NetMus login}
\label{fig:login}
\end{figure}
\\
Here is the login page to enter \co{NetMus} (figure \ref{fig:login}). If you are
a Google user, you can join \co{NetMus} using your Google account, or create a
new account on the system.

\subsubsection*{Login using a Google account}
You have to select the Google login and click on the button ``Log in
NetMus using your Google Account'' (figure \ref{fig:loginGoogle}). You will be
redirected to the Google login page, here you get logged in and then you will be redirected again to
\co{NetMus}, but this time you will be logged to the system.\\

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=14cm]{img/MU/loginGoogle.png}
\caption{Interface to Google login}
\label{fig:loginGoogle}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Creating a new NetMus account}
If you aren't a Google user and this is your first access to \co{NetMus}, you
have to create your own account registering to the system.
\co{NetMus} registration and use are completely free.

To view the registration forms, just select the voice ``Sign up in to NetMus'',
and the view will change showing you registration fields (figure
\ref{fig:registrazione}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=14cm]{img/MU/registration.png}
\caption{Interface to join NetMus}
\label{fig:registrazione}
\end{figure}

To register yourself to the system you need to insert a correct email address
and a password with more than 5 characters. Once you have created your account,
you will have free access to \co{NetMus} system.

\newpage
\subsection{First Access to NetMus}

When you first access the system, on loading you
will be asked whether to run the signed applet, giving him permission to access
to your computer (figure \ref{fig:permessiApplet}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{img/MU/profile_blank.png}
\caption{NetMus Homepage at first access}
\label{fig:permessiApplet}
\end{figure}

The applet is the \co{NetMus} component that seeks mp3's on your computer and
extract datas: \emph{it does not collect other information about you, and do not
contain any viruses}.

If you deny permission, the applet wont be able to access the contents of your
computer and peripherals, thus preventing the collection of information
(and then you'll not be able to add tracks).\\
This dialog will appear to request authorization each
access, unless you select ``Always trust content of
this author'' before clicking on ``Run''.\\

%---- arrivato qua.

Beginning from the left, we find a menu that presents the \co{NetMus} logo and
your \underline{nickname}, that for now is your email address. It also presents
the number of songs contained in your songs' list, that are zero at your first
access. This is playlist menu, where you will find all the playlist created: 
to create a new one, click on the red ``+'' symbol.\\
\\
The central section is the most important part of the apllication, infact this
is our music library with youtube player and other buttons for other
funcionalities.\\
\\
At the right side of the page there is a bar called ``DEVICE SCANNER BAR" that
allows the scanning process of the \underline{mass storage devices}. If you
hover this bar with your mouse pointer, the bar will expand revealing many details: a label were is
written  the scanning process status and a button for the manual scanning
process of an arbitrary directory selected.\\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{img/MU/applet_bar_open.png}
\caption{NetMus homepage with expanded DEVICE SCANNER BAR}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Start Using NetMus}

First of all if you want to take advantage of the main \co{NetMus}' peculiarity,
the online music library, it's necessary that you put an USB device in your PC.\\
Otherwise it is possible to scan a directory of your own PC, clicking
on the ``Scan Folder'' button for manual selection of the directory.\\ 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{img/MU/scan_manual.png}
\caption{Manual Scanning View}
\end{figure}

When the analysis starts you can follow the process in the DEVICE SCANNER BAR
inside its label that shows the numbers of the files that are analyzed until
the message ``Sending Done'' appears, that indicates that all the files have
been sent to the music library.\\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{img/MU/song_loaded.png}
\caption{View with some songs on the Music Library}
\end{figure}

Once the files have been sent, they should appear inside your music library.\\
Now it's possible for you to start using \co{NetMus} funcionalities.\\
All the actions that you can perform to take advantage of \co{NetMus} are listed
in subparagraphs some lines below for searching and viewing comfort.


\section{Permitted Actions}
In the section below we present all the actions that you are allowed to perform
to take advantage of \co{NetMus} funcionalities.

\subsection{Display Modality}

The library is the central part of \co{NetMus}. Here you can find an ordinate
list of your songs saved by the scanning process of your devices. It's possible
to have two different views of the same library.\\
\\
The first is the list modality, that is the default modality. In this
way songs are listed with the informations about the title, the artist and the
album. You can also order your songs by clicking on the superior bar the voice
``artist'', ``title'', ``album''.\\

---------list view mode picture------------
\\

The second is the ``cover mode'' modality in wich your songs are listed with the
cover of their own album. This is a nicer way to view the songs, and it is also
a better way to recognized the same album's songs.\\

 \subsection*{Listening a song in streaming}

product, the streaming funcionality.\\
If you want to listen one of your songs, you just have to select it from the
library, then click on play button of the top player, or the
bottom YouTube player.\\

The function of the two players is the same, but they have some differences.
The player at the top of the page allows to play a song, but also
allows to shift at the next song or the previous, meanwhile the bottom player
transforms itselfs in a YouTube streaming video player, where your selected song
is reproduced. Furthermore that player shows YouTube link to the video, and if
you click on it you will be redirected to the YouTube page of the song video.\\

\subsection*{View system and your account's statistics}


\newpage
\section{Errors and their Possible Reasons}

\subsection*{The USB device can't be scanned}
\begin{itemize}
  \item maybe the DEVICE SCANNER BAR isn't enable. Check on the DEVICE SCANNER
  BAR menu the label on the bottom-right side: the scanning process is disabled
  if the button displays the red word ``Enable''.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Some songs that were in the device haven't been stored in the
library}
\begin{itemize}
  \item maybe these songs had been analyzed some time before. To be sure of
  this, you can check the log that \co{NetMus} create inside your device with
  the list of the scanned songs.
  \item your mp3 songs hasn't all the most important tags complete. If an mp3
  file hasn't the tag artist, album and title complete with information, the
  song will not be stored on your library because it's impossible to identify
  what song is that.
  \item the song has tags, but they're corrupted. Sometimes can happen, especially
  with downloaded songs, that tags are present but they're not readable. Try to 
  modify them with any program and to save them, probably it will resolve this problem.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The song reproduced by the YouTube player is not the correct one}
\begin{itemize}
  \item the YouTube research funcionality not always produces correct results.
  It's possible to listen the next song found by YouTube by clicking on the button
  ``Wrong Song''. With that funcionality there are more possibilities to find
  the correct song you want listen.
  \item the informations tag of this song are incorrect, so the searching
  process couldn't find the correct song you want. Change the informations of
  this song to have a correct search answer from the player.
\end{itemize}
