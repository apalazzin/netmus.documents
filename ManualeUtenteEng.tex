Beginning from the left, we find a menu that presents the \co{NetMus} logo and

access. This is playlist menu, infact here we can find all the playlist you have
created, and it also leads creating new ones by clicking on the red ``+''
symbol.\\
\\
The central section is the most important part of the apllication, infact this
is our music library with youtube player and other buttons for other
funcionalities.\\
\\
At the right side of the page there is a bar called ``DEVICE SCANNER BAR" that
allows the scanning process of the devices. If you hover this bar with your
mouse pointer, the bar will expand revealing many details: a label were is
written  the scanning process status and a button for the manual scanning
process of an arbitrary directory selected.\\

\caption{NetMus homepage with expanded DEVICE SCANNER BAR}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Start Using NetMus}

the online music library, it necessary that you put an USB device in your PC.\\

on the ``Scan Folder'' button for manual selection of the directory.\\

appeared the message ``Sending Done'' that indicates that all the files have
been sent to the music library.\\

to take advantage of \co{NetMus} funcionalities.

The library is the central part of \co{NetMus}. Here you can find an ordinate
list of your songs saved by the scanning process of your devices. It's possible
to have two different views of the same library.\\
\\
The first is the list modality, that is the default modality. In this
way songs are listed with the informations about the title, the artist and the
album. You can also order your songs by clicking on the superior bar the voice
``artist'', ``title'', ``album''.\\

product, the streaming funcionality.\\

library, then click on tha play button of the top \underline{player}, or the
bottom YouTube player.\\

The function of the two players is the same, but they have some differences.

allows to shift at the next song or the previous, meanwhile the bottom player
transforms itselfs in a YouTube streaming video player, where your selected song
is reproduced. Furthermore that player shows YouTube link to the video, and if
you click on it you will be redirected to the YouTube page of the song video.\\
